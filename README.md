Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
For FrontEnd I used basic HTML CSS .

The latest official version is 3.0.7. Read the 3.0.7 release notes, then install it with pip:

As part of the Django 3.1 development process, Django 3.1b1 is available. This release is only for users who want to try the new version and help identify remaining bugs before the 3.1 release. Please read the 3.1 release notes before using this package.

Install the beta with pip:

Option 3: Get the latest development version
The latest and greatest Django version is the one that’s in our Git repository (our revision-control system). This is only for experienced users who want to try incoming changes and help identify bugs before an official release. Get it using this shell command, which requires Git:

git clone https://github.com/django/django.git

You can also download a gzipped tarball of the development version. This archive is updated every time we commit code.
